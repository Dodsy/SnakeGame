This was my first solo project where I explored java swing.

I did this by breaking down the problem into smaller bite sized pieces.

## Steps to make a snake game without googling "how to make a snake game"

1. Make a program where you can place a square on a board and click again to remove it.

2. Add in functionality to move the square with arrow keys.

3. Add in functionality that the square will continue moving in the direction pressed on the arrow keys, will just go to the other side if it hits an edge

4. Turn square white, make all squares black, remove ability to click to add square, make it randomly spawn at the beginning

5. Add red “apple”. If square touches apple make a new apple in a random location and remove the initial apple, add score panel that keeps track of how many apples eaten

6. If square touches apple add another square behind it that follows the first square

7. Add in collision detection on tail and walls

8. Done
